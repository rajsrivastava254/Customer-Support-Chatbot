# AI Customer Support Chatbot with RAG

A conversational AI chatbot designed to provide instant and accurate answers to customer support questions using a custom knowledge base.
This project leverages Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ensure responses are factual and grounded in provided documents, minimizing AI hallucinations.

**üöÄ Overview**

This application provides a user-friendly web interface where users can ask questions in natural language.
The backend processes the query using a RAG pipeline:

Retrieves the most relevant information from a local knowledge base (support_data.txt).

Uses Google Gemini Pro to generate a coherent, context-aware answer.

Additionally, the chatbot includes a Text-to-Speech (TTS) feature to speak answers aloud, improving accessibility.

**‚ú® Key Features**

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Ensures answers are accurate and based solely on the provided knowledge base.

Free & Local Embeddings: Powered by Hugging Face models for cost-free local embeddings.

Google Gemini LLM: Leverages the free tier of Gemini Pro for high-quality responses.

Interactive UI: Built with Streamlit for a simple, intuitive experience.

Text-to-Speech (TTS): Converts answers to audio using gTTS.

Customizable Knowledge: Easily update chatbot knowledge by editing a single file (support_data.txt).
